\section{Conclusions}
The DUNE's baseline is 1300 km and it's expected to be enough to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and also CP-violation phase. These two important neutrino mixing parameters were never measured before.

However, the LBNF will not be able to measure the neutrino masses themselves - neutrino oscillations are only sensitive to differences. Neutrino mass measurement require different kind of experiments - for example, studiyng high energy cut-off on the electron energy spectrum in beta-decay of tritium but so far all the experiments trying to measure it were able only to set limits on neutrino masses (\cite{ref_Griffiths}, 11.4).
