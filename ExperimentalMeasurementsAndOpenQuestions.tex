\subsection{Open Questions}
According Particle Data Group Review \ref{ref_PDG} the following questions will be the main priority to answer by current and future neutrino experiments:
\begin{itemize}
  \item whether the massive neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana (Dirac neutrinos are... Majorana neutrinos are...)
  \item what is the sign of $\Delta{m_A}^2$ ($\Delta{m_31}^2$) and what is the type of the neutrino mass spectrum [WHAT IS THAT]
  \item what the absolute values of neutrino masses are
  \item what is the value of the neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{13}$
  \item how does the CP-symmetry behaves in the lepton sector
  \item what the values of $\Delta{m_{12}}^2$, $\theta_{12}$, and $|\Delta{m_{31}}^2|$, $\theta_{23}$.
  \item are the neutrino oscillations indication of new fundamental symmetry in particle physics
  \item what is the relation between neutrino and quark mixing if any
  \item what is the nature of the CP-violation terms in the neutrino mixing matrix
  \item can better understanding of neutrino mixing give a hint to baryon assymetry in the Universe 
\end{itemize}
