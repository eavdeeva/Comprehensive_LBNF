# Comprehensive_LBNF
paper (and possibly presentation) for my comprehensive exam regarding LBNF and neutrino mixing
The topic:
For your comprehensive exam, we would like you to explore and discuss the physics program of the proposed LBNF.  You should start by explaining the current state of our knowledge of neutrino masses and mixing, and what the open questions are.  Some brief discussion of how the relevant measurements were performed will probably be necessary.  Then, in this context, explain the need for LBNF, describe what measurements it will be able to do to address the questions and how they will be performed.  Describe the technical requirements on the facility (both for the production of the neutrino beams and for the performance of the detectors) to be successful in this endeavor, and how it is expected that they will be met.  As a by-product, also briefly discuss which important questions about neutrinos cannot be addressed by LBNF and would require other facilities.  Of course, be as quantitative as possible throughout the entire discussion.
