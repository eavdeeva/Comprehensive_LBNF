\section{Conclusions}

Neutrino oscillations were first observed in 1960s and confirmed in 1998. Neutrinos were believed to be massless for a long time, but the oscillations assume neutrinos to be massive. Therefore the phenomenon made the scientific community to rethink the theory of weak interactions. While several possible theoretical frameworks to incorporate neutrino masses into the Standard Model were suggested, it is not clear which hypothesis is true. Precision measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters may bring insight into understanding of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe and general picture of the generations of the fundamental Standard Model particles. \\

Neutrino oscillations can be described with four parameters of neutrino mixing matrix (three angles $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$, $\theta_{13}$ and complex CP-violating phase $\delta$) and two mass differences (${\Delta}m_{21}$ and ${\Delta}m_{32}$).\\

Neutrino oscillations can be studied with solar, atmospheric, reactor, or accelerator neutrino experiments. Key idea of any neutrino oscillation experiment is to observe and quantitatively describe disappearance of neutrinos/antineutrinos which were produced and/or appearance of neutrinos/antineutrinos which were not produced. Then probability of neutrinos to oscillate is built and fitted in assumption of certain model, and the neutrino oscillation parameters are extracted.\\

Significant progress was made in the past years in neutrino oscillation physics with all four types of experiments. Three angles $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$, $\theta_{13}$ have been measured with several degrees precision, absolute values of ${\Delta}m_{21}$ and ${\Delta}m_{32}$ were measured too, and it is known that $m_2 > m_1$. However, all previous experiments were not sensitive enough to determine sign of ${\Delta}m_{32}$ and phase $\delta$.\\

That is why new LBNF/DUNE experiment was proposed. It will be accelerator long baseline neutrino oscillations experiment. The highest ever neutrino beam power, the longest baseline and the most effective far detector would make LBNF/DUNE the most ambitious neutrino oscillations experiment in the World and sensitive to the effects which were not observed by any other experiment to date. LBNF/DUNE is expected to determine sign of ${\Delta}m_{32}$ with high significance, phase $\delta$ in broad range of values, and provide the most precise test of the three-neutrino oscillations theory.\\
