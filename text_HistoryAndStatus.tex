\section{Neutrino Oscillations. History and Status}
%\subsection{First Discovery and Confirmation}

History of the neutrino oscillations discovery is described in \cite{ref_Griffiths}, chapter 11. The first evidence of the neutrino oscillations had place in the Homestake experiment in 1968 with solar neutrinos which registered number of neutrinos three times smaller then theoretically predicted. The phenomenon was called "solar neutrino problem". This experiment used Chlorino radiochemical detector. Neutrino interacted with chlorine-37 atom and converted it to argon-37 through the reaction $\nu_e+^{37}Cl \rightarrow ^{37}Ar+e$ or, at more fundamental level, $\nu_e+n \rightarrow p+e$. Then argon atoms were separated and counted. The detector was sensitive to electron neutrinos only. Soon after Bruno Pontecorvo proposed the explanation to the solar neutrino problem that neutrino can change its flavor on its way from the Sun to the detector. The theory was confirmed  by Super-Kamiokande and Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) collaborations. \\

Super-Kamiokande experiment used water detector and could register any sort of neutrino through the $e+\nu \rightarrow e+\nu$ scattering. But the NC scattering can not distinguish between different neutrino flavors and also electron neutrinos could interact through CC which made detection efficiency of electron neutrinos 6.5 times higher than other flavors (the left Feynman diagram in Fig. \ref{fig:NuScattering} is possible for any neutrino flavor but the middle and right diagrams are possible only for electron neutrino). Therefore, Super-Kamiokande was able to register any neutrino but could not distinguish between neutrino flavor and had lower detection efficiency for non-electron neutrinos. They assumed all neutrinos to be electron neutrinos and recorded $45\%$ of the predicted amount. Then the SNO which used heavy water and were able to measure separately electron and total neutrino flux, confirmed that some of neutrinos coming from the Sun are registered as $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$. The reactions in the working volumes of the three detectors can be summarized as the following:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Homestake experiment (1968): $\nu_e + ^{37}Cl \rightarrow ^{37}Ar+e$
\item Super-Kamiokande experiment (1998): $\nu + e \rightarrow \nu + e$ 
\item Solar neutrino observatory (2002): $\nu_e + d \rightarrow p+p+e$, $\nu+d \rightarrow n+p+\nu$, $\nu+e \rightarrow \nu+e$
\end{itemize}

The SNO reported $\nu_e$ flux to be $35\%$ of the predicted flux. Comparing it to the Super-Kamiokande results and knowing that Super-Kamiokande was 6.5 times less sensitive to $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$, one could get:\\
$N_{SNO}=0.35 \cdot N_{th}$\\
$N_{SK}^{CORR1}=0.45 \cdot N_{th}=0.35 \cdot N_{th}+0.1 \cdot N_{th}$\\
$N_{SK}^{CORR1}=\frac{N_{SK}^{REG}}{\epsilon^{e}}=0.45 \cdot N_{th} $\\
$N_{SK}^{CORR2}=\alpha \cdot \frac{N_{SK}^{REG}}{\epsilon^{e}}+(1-\alpha) \cdot \frac{N_{SK}^{REG}}{\epsilon^{\mu/\tau}}=\alpha \cdot \frac{N_{SK}^{REG}}{\epsilon^{e}}+(1-\alpha) \cdot \frac{N_{SK}^{REG}}{\epsilon^{e}/6.5}$\\
$\alpha=0.35/0.45$\\
$N_{SK}^{CORR2}=0.35 \cdot N_{th}+0.65 \cdot N_{th}=N_{th}$\\
where $N_{th}$ is number of theoretically predicted neutrinos, $N_{SNO}$ is number of neutrinos registered by the SNO experiment corrected by neutrino detection efficiency, $N_{SK}^{REG}$ is number of neutrinos registered by Super-Kamiokande, $N_{SK}^{CORR1}$ is number of neutrinos registered by Super-Kamiokande corrected by electron detection efficiency, $\epsilon^{e}$ is electron detection efficiency, $N_{SK}^{CORR2}$ is number of neutrinos registered by Super-Kamiokande corrected in assumption that part of registered neutrinos were $\nu_e$ and the other part were $\nu_\mu$ or $\nu_\tau$.

The result of these calculations is:\\
\begin{center}
$N_{SK}^{CORR2}=N_{th}$\\
\end{center}

After that, the neutrino oscillations theory is considered to be confirmed and the solar neutrino problem resolved.\\


%\subsection{First measurements of the neutrino oscillation parameters}

There are four types of experiments which allow to study neutrino properties: solar, atmospheric, reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments \cite{ref_PDG}. Idea of any neutrino oscillation measurement is to observe and quantify disappearance of the sort of $\nu$/$\bar{\nu}$ which was produced and/or appearance of the sort of $\nu$/$\bar{\nu}$ which was not produced.\\

The Sun is a source of electron neutrinos, they are produced in the reactions $4p \rightarrow {^4}He+2e^{+}+2\nu_{e}$. Solar neutrino experiments (as the three described above) looking for the disappearance of $\nu_e$ and appearance of $\nu_\mu$ and sometimes $\nu_\tau$. These experiments are characterized by very long baseline (distance from the Sun to the Earth, $\simeq 1.5 \cdot 10^8$ km) and neutrino energies of $\simeq 1$ MeV. Solar neutrino experiments are sensitive to ${\Delta}m^2_{21}={\Delta}m^2_{Sol}$ which is also called Solar mass splitting. The first measurements of $\theta_{12}$ came from the Solar neutrino experiments too.\\

Nuclear reactors produce $\bar{\nu_e}$s in beta decay of radioactive elements $n \rightarrow p + e^- + \bar{\nu_e}$, and then antineutrinos further oscillate and are detected. Typical baselines of such experiments vary from 1 to 100 km, and the energies of emitted antineutrinos are $\simeq 1$ MeV. Reactor experiments provide measurements of ${\Delta}m^2_{21}$, $\theta_{12}$, and $\theta_{13}$.\\

Source of atmospheric neutrinos is cosmic rays scattering off the air molecules as shown in the Fig. \ref{fig:cosmicMuons}. Pions produced in the air decay as $\pi^{\pm} \rightarrow \mu^{\pm}+\nu_\mu(\bar{\nu_\mu})$ with further muon decay $\mu^{\pm} \rightarrow e^{\pm}+\nu_e(\bar{\nu_e})+\bar{\nu_\mu}(\nu_\mu)$ which lead to fluxes ratio $\Phi(\nu_\mu+\bar{\nu_\mu}):\Phi(\nu_e+\bar{\nu_e}) \approx 2:1$. Baseline of atmospheric neutrinos experiments is $\simeq 10^4$ km, and neutrino energies are $\simeq 1$ GeV. Atmospheric neutrino experiments are more sensitive to ${\Delta}m^2_{32}={\Delta}m^2_{Atm}$ which is also called atmospheric mass splitting, and also provide measurements of $\theta_{23}$. Such experiments are also potentially capable of measuring CP-violating phase $\delta$ but experiments has been performed so far were not sensitive enough to measure $\delta$. \\

Accelerators can produce $\nu_\mu$ or $\bar{\nu_\mu}$ similarly as $\nu_\mu$/$\bar{\nu_\mu}$ are produced in the atmosphere but the accelerator can produce high purity $\nu_\mu$ or $\bar{\nu_\mu}$ beam by choice. Neutrino energies produced by accelerators are $\simeq 1$ GeV, and the baselines are few hundred kilometers. Fixed baseline and better understood neutrino beam spectrum lead to potentially more precise measurements than atmospheric experiments. Accelerator experiments target on measuring ${\Delta}m^2_{32}$, $\theta_{23}$, $\theta_{13}$ and $\delta$ but, similarly to atmospheric experiments, the experiments have been performed so far were not sensitive enough to measure $\delta$. Also, having neutrinos long distance to travel through matter, accelerator experiments can be sensitive to mass hierarchy. But by now it is only known that $m_2>m_1$ and $|{\Delta}m_{21}| \ll |{\Delta}m_{32}|$ but it is not known whether $m_3>m_2>m_1$ or $m_2>m_1>m_3$.\\ 

%\subsection{Recent Experimental Results}
To summarize, among the neutrino oscillation parameters all three mixing angles and two mass differences have been measured, however sign of ${\Delta}m^2_{32}$ is not known and CP-violating phase $\delta$ is also not known. Currently available experimental results are summarized in the Table \ref{tab:MeasuredPars}.\\

%Section 14.5 in [REFERENCE] describes measurements of $\Delta{m^2_A}$ and $\theta_A$, splitting between atmospheric neutrino and accelerator experiments results. Section 14.6 reviews measurements of $\theta_{13}$ which was measured recently.

The following questions related to neutrino oscillations remain unknown: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item whether the massive neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana?
  \item what is the mass hierarchy ($m_3>m_2>m_1$ or $m_2>m_1>m_3$)?
  \item what the absolute values of neutrino masses are?
  \item how does the CP-symmetry behaves in the lepton sector (what is value of $\delta$ in the neutrino mixing matrix)?
  \item are the neutrino oscillations indication of new fundamental symmetry in particle physics?
  \item what is the relation between neutrino and quark mixing if any?
  \item can better understanding of neutrino mixing give a hint to matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe?
  \item what is octant of $\theta_{23}$ angle?
\end{itemize}
