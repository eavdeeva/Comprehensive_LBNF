Charged leptons and quarks (fermions) are subject to electromagnetic interactions (through photons). Quarks also interact strongly (through gluons). All leptons and quarks interact weakly (through $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$ bosons). All of the fundamental particles of the Standard Model have been discovered, and nothing more.

The Standard Model can be summarized in the table in Fig. \ref{fig:StandardModel}. It includes three charged leptons, three neutrinos, six quarks and their antiparticles, which are split into three generations. In addition, it includes the gauge bosons, the Higgs boson and three fundamental interactions: electromagnetic, strong and weak. Charged particles, which include three leptons (electrons, muons and $\tau$-leptons), all quarks, W bosons and their antiparticles can interact electromagnetically, through exchange of virtual photon. Quarks have non-integer electric charges (in units of absolute value of the electron charge) of +2/3 or -1/3. They also possess an additional quantum number which is called "color" and can participate in strong couplings, through exchange of gluons. Individual quarks do not exist in the nature, they are present in combinations of three quarks or quark-antiquark pairs. Particles composed of three quarks are called baryons, and particles composed of quark and antiquark are called mesons. Baryons and mesons are always neutral in color, and possess integer electric charge. All baryons and mesons are called hadrons.\\ \\
All of these particles and also neutrinos can interact through weak interactions, through charged current (CC), by exchanging a W boson, and through neutral current (NC), by exchanging a Z boson. The corresponding Feynman diagrams for NC and CC are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:NuScattering}. The left Feynman diagram shows an electron scattering off a neutrino through NC. Any neutrino or antineutrino can scatter off an electron with NC. Moreover, any weakly interacting particle can scatter off any other weakly interacting particle through NC because $Z^0$ does not transform a particle into any other particle, but is just emitted from the fermion line. The middle Feynman diagram in Fig. \ref{fig:NuScattering} shows $e^- \nu_e \rightarrow e^- \nu_e$ scattering through CC. The W boson transforms the neutrino into a corresponding charged lepton or vice-verse and therefore only $f^- \nu_f \rightarrow f^- \nu_f$ scattering is possible with CC where $f$ is $e$, $\mu$ or $\tau$. For example, $e^- \nu_\mu \rightarrow e^- \nu_\mu$ scattering is possible through NC only. The right Feynman diagram shows the process of $e^- \bar{\nu_e}$ annihilation with further production of $e^- \bar{\nu_e}$. In principle, any $f^- \bar{\nu_f}$ or $f^+ \nu_f$ pair could get produced via the exchange of a W boson.\\ \\
All known substances in the known Universe consist of millions of different species of molecules which are composed of hundreds of different species of atoms. Each atom consists of a certain number of protons, neutrons and electrons. All protons and neutrons are composed of three quarks (uud for the proton and udd for the neutron) which are glued together by strong interactions. Therefore, all known substance consists of only the three fundamental particles from Fig. \ref{fig:StandardModel}: u- and d-quarks and electrons. Despite the fact that neutrinos are not a part of substances, a large number of them exist in nature without any human-built machines. Quoting \cite{ref_Griffiths}, 11.1: ``John Bahcall, who was responsible for most of the calculations of solar neutrino abundances, liked to say that 100 billion neutrinos pass through your thumbnail every second; and yet they are so ethereal that you can look forward to only one or two neutrino-induced reaction in your body during your entire lifetime".\\ \\
Two very common and well known interactions with neutrino participation are neutron beta decay and muon decay. The Feynman diagrams of these processes are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:MuonAndNeutronDecays}. The mean lifetime of a free neutron is $~15$ minutes and it decays by $n \rightarrow p + e^- + \bar{{\nu}_e} $ \cite{ref_PDG}. At the level of fundamental particles, neutrons consist of two d-quarks and one u-quark and in the beta decay one of the d-quarks transforms into a u-quark through the weak interaction mediated by a $W^- $ boson. Thus, the proton, which consists of two u-quarks and one d-quark, is being produced from neutron beta decay. When this happens, an electron and an electron antineutrino are emitted to conserve the charge and lepton flavor number. Examples of the neutron beta decay in nature include ${^{49}}{_{19}}K \rightarrow {^{40}}{_{20}}Ca$, ${^{64}}{_{29}}Cu \rightarrow {^{64}}{_{30}}Zn$, ${^3}{_1}H \rightarrow {^3}{_2}He$ \cite{ref_Griffiths} (the positive beta decay,  $p \rightarrow n + e^+ + {\nu}_e $, is forbidden for free proton by energy conservation but it is allowed in certain cases when a proton is part of a nuclei). Such reactions are widely used for neutrino and antineutrino detection.\\\\
As for a muon, it's mean lifetime is $~2 {\mu}s$, and it decays as ${\mu}^- \rightarrow e^- + {\nu}_{\mu} + \bar{{\nu}_e}$ through the W boson. This process is also common in nature in cosmic rays as shown at Fig. \ref{fig:cosmicMuons}. Highly energetic cosmic protons scatter off the atmosphere molecules, for instance, as $p+p \rightarrow n+p+\pi^+$, $p+n \rightarrow n+n+\pi^-$ and $p+p \rightarrow p+p+\pi^0$. Several additional hadrons can be produced in the reaction. If $\pi^0$ is produced, it decays to two photons $\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$. Charged pions decay $\pi^{\pm} \rightarrow \mu^{\pm} + \nu_\mu(\bar{\nu_\mu})$ and then some number of muons decay $\mu^{\pm} \rightarrow e^{\pm} + \nu_e(\bar{\nu_e}) + \bar{\nu_\mu}(\nu_\mu)$ while traveling through the atmosphere to the ground. A Feynman diagram of muon decay is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:MuonAndNeutronDecays}. The muon transforms into muon neutrino with emission of a W boson, then the W boson decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino.\\ \\
There are three flavors of neutrinos, one for each generation: electron neutrino, muon neutrino, and $\tau$-neutrino. In the processes described above (neutron beta decay and muon decay) the lepton flavor numbers $L_e$, $L_{\mu}$ and $L_{\tau}$ are conserved. Table \ref{tab:LeptonFlavorNumber} shows the value of this number for all leptons and anti-leptons. \\ \\
Lepton flavor number is conserved in almost all particle physics processes and the only violation of this law ever observed is through neutrino oscillations: the ability of a neutrino to change flavor.\\ \\
This paper is about neutrino oscillations. Chapter 2 of this paper reviews the theoretical background of neutrino oscillations starting from a simplified two-neutrino model in vacuum to a three-neutrino model in the presence of matter; and also discusses possible mechanisms to give neutrinos mass. Chapter 3 gives a historical background of related experimental measurements including the first evidence of neutrino oscillations, and milestones achieved by the scientific community in measuring different neutrino oscillation parameters including the most recent experimental results. Chapter 4 explains the need of a new experiment and gives an overview of the proposed LBNF/DUNE experiment in terms of its physics program and experimental setup. It also discusses the advantages of LBNF/DUNE by comparison of the other experiments of this kind. Chapter 5 draws conclusions on the potential scientific impact of the proposed LBNF/DUNE project.  \\ \\
