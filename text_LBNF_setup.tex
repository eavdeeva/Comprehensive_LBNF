While neutrino oscillation physics has significantly developed in recent years, there are still several questions remaining. Previous experiments were not sensitive enough to measure $\delta$ phase in the neutrino mixing matrix or to determine mass hierarchy; thus, a new experiment, the LBNF/DUNE, has been proposed to answer remaining issues.\\ \\
The Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) is being internationally designed for the future Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) for the precision measurements of neutrino oscillations parameters and related searches beyond the Standard Model. The general scheme of the facility is shown on Fig. \ref{fig:LBNF_overallScheme}. The basic idea of the neutrino oscillation accelerator experiment is to produce a muon neutrino beam, measure neutrino flux a few hundred meters downstream the beam at the near detector (ND), and measure muon neutrino disappearance and/or electron neutrino appearance several hundred kilometers downstream at the far detector (FD). Measurements at two points allow to probe neutrino oscillation predictions. In the case of LBNF/DUNE, beam production system and the ND will be located at Fermilab in Illinois, and the FD will be located 1300 km away at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in South Dakota. \\ \\

% Summary
LBNF/DUNE is future long baseline neutrino oscillations experiment which will be hosted by two large physics laboratories in USA: Fermilab in Illinois and SURF in South Dakota. LBNF/DUNE's baseline of 1300 km, expected beam power of 2 MW, and 40 kt of liquid argon FD makes LBNF/DUNE the most ambitious neutrino oscillations facility ever created. In addition to precision measurements of neutrino mixing parameters such as $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$, $\theta_{13}$, $|\Delta{m_{12}}^2|$, $|\Delta{m_{32}}^2|$, it is expected to have enough sensitivity to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and the CP-violation phase $\delta$ which have never been previously determined.\\ \\
