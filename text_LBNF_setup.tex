\section{LBNF/DUNE Project}

While neutrino oscillation physics has been significantly developed during past years, there are still several questions remain unknown. Previous experiments were not sensitive enough to measure $\delta$ phase in the neutrino mixing matrix, and to determine mass hierarchy. That is why a new experiment was proposed: LBNF/DUNE.\\

The Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) is the facility being internationally designed for the future Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) for the precision measurements of neutrino oscillations parameters and related searches beyond the Standard Model. The general scheme of the facility is shown on Fig. \ref{fig:LBNF_overallScheme}. Basic idea of an accelerator neutrino oscillations physics experiment is to produce muon neutrino beam, measure neutrino flux few hundred meters downstream the beam at the near detector (ND), and measure muon neutrino disappearance and/or electron neutrino appearance several hundred kilometers downstream the beam at the far detector (FD). Measurements at two points allow to probe neutrino oscillation predictions. In case of LBNF/DUNE, beam production system and the ND will be located at Fermilab in Illinois, and the FD will be located 1300 km away at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in South Dakota. \\

% Summary

LBNF/DUNE is future long baseline neutrino oscillations experiment which will be hosted by two large physics laboratories in USA: Fermilab in Illinois and SURF in South Dakota. LBNF/DUNE's baseline of 1300 km, expected beam power of 2 MW, and 40 kt of liquid argon FD makes LBNF/DUNE the most ambitious neutrino oscillations facility ever created. In addition to precision measurements of such neutrino mixing parameters as $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$, $\theta_{13}$, $|\Delta{m_{12}}^2|$, $|\Delta{m_{32}}^2|$, it is expected to have enough sensitivity to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and the CP-violation phase $\delta$ which were never determined before.\\
