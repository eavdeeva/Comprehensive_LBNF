The Long Beamline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) is the facility being internationally designed for the future Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) for the precision measurements of neutrino oscillations parameters and related searches beyond the Standard Model. The general scheme of the facility is shown on figure \ref{fig:LBNF_overallScheme}.

Then neutrinos will be registered by near detector, travel 1300 km to the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota and be registed by far detector. Source of figure: \cite{ref_LBNFweb} }

The overall scheme of the LBNF/DUNE experimental setup is shown at the (fig. \ref{fig:LBNF_overallScheme}). The protons from the accelerator  will induce the neutrino beam which will be travelling trough the Earth in direction of the far detector in South Dakota. It is common for the long baseline neutrino oscillations experiments to have a near detector (ND) (several hundred meters from the neutrino production) and far detector (FD) (hundreds of kilometers away). Comparing measurements of neutrino flux characteristics at two points allows to extract parameters of neutrino oscillations physics.

% Summary

The LBNF is the long baseline neutrino oscillations experiment under development which will be hosted by two large physics laboratories in USA: Fermilab in Illinois and SURF in South Dakota. \\  

The LBNF's baseline of 1300 km, expected beam power of 2 MW, 40 kt of liquid argon far detector makes the LBNF the most ambitious neutrino oscillations facility ever created. In addition to presicion measurements of such neutrino mixing parameters as $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$, $\theta_{13}$, $|\Delta{m_{12}}^2|$, $|\Delta{m_{31}}^2|$, it's expected to have enough sensitivity to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and the CP-violation phase $\delta_{CP}$ which were never determined before.\\
